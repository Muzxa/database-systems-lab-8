## Setup Instructions

To initialize the required Node.js modules for both the client and server, please run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
cd website/client
npm install
npm start
```

In another terminal...

```sh
cd website/server
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install all dependencies needed to run the client and server applications and run them.
